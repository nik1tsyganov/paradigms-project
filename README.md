# About The Project

## Built With
List here all the dependencies of your project (including version). For example:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

1. To run our project
  - clone into the Github repo or download the code from our Gradescope submission
  - Ensure you are running Django 3.2.9+ and Python 3.9+
  - cd to the topmost rest_server directory and run `python3 manage.py runserver`

2. Once the server is running, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/projects/ in a Web browser

3. The web app should be detailed enough that a user can navigate throughout and create/read/update/delete projects, tasks, and timers.
